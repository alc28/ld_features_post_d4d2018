Library users will be able to trace libraries of individual collectors, or trace the paths individual books from their printing to the present.The Linked Jazz project uses name authority records in VIAF to link names mentioned in documents. This allows for deeper searching of documents by linking specific pieces of text within a document, rather than a whole document. This will help users conduct detailed research on jazz musicians.In special collections and rare book librarianship, item-level metadata is very important. This information allows users to identify copy-specific information, such as localized bindings, trace former owners, find text corrections, and so forth. However, current tools do not support this work well. Item-level data tends to reside in local catalogs. As a result, users who start their research in WorldCat risk missing this valuable information completely. Although this project is in its early stages, the rare book community is hoping to leverage linked data to provide item-specific metadata in a more searchable way.

R_3EZmVPtp2E3g3Ed,Linked data does not have library users in mind as the system's clientele. Linked data is supposed to allow internet users (semantic web users) to access information stored in library knowledge bases without having to learn how to navigate the traditional catalog. There is a belief that there will be synergistic amplification when library-accumulated knowledge interacts better with the knowledge bases of other communities. It has little to do with the discoverability of library collections except indirectly. Digitizing special collections material has received some increased priority because of a belief that processing them using linked data protocols is moving library collections in general closer to a linked data future. There is no proof of this.,2,0,0,1,3
R_1gztyDx7mEUx9rF,"I see absolutely *no* benefit to individual libraries or consortia using linked data.  In fact, I see it creating too much chaos.  The better model, in my mind would be for the major bibliographic utilities (such as OCLC), vendors (such as Ex Libris) and libraries of record (such as the Library of Congress, Harvard, Yale, etc.) to publish their metadata as BIBFRAME for ingestion by search engines and virtual assistants.  We're honestly going about this all wrong.  Think about how the cinema industry works:  show times aren't published as linked data directly to the search engines and virtual assistants; they are delivered to services like Fandango or IMDB and the search engines and virtual assistants then ingest the linked data from a centralized service.  This is how we need to operate.  Moreover, BIBFRAME should not be thought of as a replacement for MARC.  MARC is an excellent format for what it does.  Rather, BIBFRAME should live alongside MARC for the sole purpose of the major players publishing linked data.",3,0,0,1,4
